Simply put, this is a compatibility layer for running Android apps on GNU/Linux

The goal is to implement the parts of the Android Open Source Project required by the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) in a way that
- allows compatibility with Linux/GNU, and
- avoids duplicating functionality

For more information, see:
- AOSP Homepage: https://source.android.com/ 
- CDD Page: https://source.android.com/compatibility/cdd 

The AOSP Repostories are hosted at https://android.googlesource.com/, and most of the code is in the platform/ subdirectory.
